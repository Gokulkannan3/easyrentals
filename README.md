#Project Idea

This rental application works based on the role based authentication.
Where in the user while login will be checked on four types of category
1) Owner
2) Normal User
3) Student
4) PG Rooms
Based on this their bookings will be different Mkaes easy way of finding out invividual user category based houses.

The owner will be posting the house for based on the three categories so that the data can be filtered easily and ca be seen by the each category user.
The enuriry raised by normal user or student or pg room users notifications will be sent to owner via node mailer the mail sent to the owner.
Can also see the enquiries by the app ans should be able to accept the request after the enquiry and also cancel if the owner is not satisfied and if canceled entire databade of selecte enquiry will be deleted.

If the owner accepts the enquiry request mail will be sent via node mailer to the user whoe requested for enquiry.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
